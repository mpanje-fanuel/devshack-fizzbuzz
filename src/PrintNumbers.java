	 * FizzBuzz
	 *
	 * Write a program that prints the numbers in the given range. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of
	 * the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five
	 * print “FizzBuzz”. Print a new line after each string or number.
	 *
	 * the number of test cases, denoted by T,
	 * and T [whitespace separated] integers, denoted by N.
	 *
	 * Output Format For each testcase, print the number from 1 to N. But follow the rules given in the problem
	 * statement.
	 *
	 * Constraints
	 *
	 * 1 <= T <= 10
	 *
	 * N is an integer.
	 *
	 * Sample input:
	 *
	 * 2
	 * 3 15
